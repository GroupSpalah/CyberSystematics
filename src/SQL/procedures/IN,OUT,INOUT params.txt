Parameters passing in stored procedure
	An IN parameter passes a value into a procedure.
	The procedure might modify the value, but the modification is not visible to the caller
	when the procedure returns.

	An OUT parameter passes a value from the procedure back to
	the caller. Its initial value is NULL within the procedure, and its value is visible to
	the caller when the procedure returns.

	An INOUT parameter is initialized by the caller,
	can be modified by the procedure, and any change made by the procedure is visible to the
	caller when the procedure returns.
